		Coding is like an art to me and I'm very much influenced by the quote <em>Code is poetry</em>.
	</p>
	<h1 class="about-me page-title">Introduction</h1>
	<p>This is Khan AKA <em>TheDramatist</em> from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Till now I've seen <span id="age-year"></span> springs and hope to see many more. I’m a former group theatre activist and I borrowed the title <em>TheDramatist</em> form there.</p>
	<p>By profession I’m a web programmer. It’s been <span id="experience-year"></span> years since I printed my very first <code>Hello World!</code>. I still remember those early 2012 days, after one year of getting admitted to university, I was playing around with computer and suddenly the name <em>PHP</em> appeared in my screen as the first result of a <em>Google</em> search. And that dragged me in <em>PHP</em> programming. Actually, I've learnt <em>PHP</em> for fun, but now it become one of my best tools. After learning basic <em>PHP</em>, I started playing around with WordPress. While playing around with WordPress, it lead me to object oriented programming, algorithm and design patterns. So I started googling and till now I'm fascinated with those. Then some days later I got introduced to Ruby, and then on I’m quite fascinated with the language. Currently my time goes mostly with <em>PHP</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>, partly with <em>Ruby</em>. I also like to play with the spreadsheet program. I'm very fond of this program so far.</p>
