	<p class="message">
		Coding is like an art to me. I'm very much influenced by the WordPress quote "Code is poetry".
	</p>
	<p>This is Khan AKA <em>TheDramatist</em> from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Till now I've seen <span id="age-year"></span> springs, hope to see many more. I’m a former group theatre activist and I borrowed the title <em>TheDramatist</em> form there.</p>
	<p>By profession I’m a web programmer. It’s been <span id="experience-year"></span> years I started programming. I still remember those days in early 2012, when I just got admitted to university. Actually I've learnt PHP for fun, but now it become one of my best tools. After learning basic PHP, I started playing around with WordPress. While playing around with WordPress, it lead me to object oriented programming, algorithm and design patterns. So I started googling and till now I'm fascinated with those. Then some days later I got introduced to Ruby, and then on I’m quite fascinated with the language. Currently my time goes mostly with PHP and JavaScript, partly with Ruby.</p>
